        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <div class="para-div">
            <p><strong>BACK WHEN WE WERE JUST A COFFEE BEAN</strong> Our journey dates back to the beginning of 2017 when during one of his global travels, Abhishek Khurana got to witness the unrivalled coffee culture in Vietnam. The rich and flavorful profile of Vietnamese coffee was unlike anything he had before and he instantly fell in love with it. Back in India, there was hardly anyone offering gourmet cold coffees and this got Abhishek wondering about the possibility of launching a ready-to-drink gourmet coffee brand in the Indian market.</p>
            <p><strong>THE KING OF COFFEE ARRIVES Brimming</strong> with hope and excitement about the potential of Kings Coffee, Abhishek set out to transform his ideas into real-life flavours. He started experimenting with innovative and quirky types of coffee that would appeal to the local palate, and feel new and fresh at the same time. After months of R&D and working with local Vietnamese farmers, Kings Coffee was finally launched under SCK International (the parent company behind KCC). It’s been over 5 years since, and Kings Cold Coffee has spread its wings throughout the country and is increasingly garnering the love of people across all age groups.</p>
            <p><strong>STORY BEHIND THE NAME We </strong>are often asked about this story. Well, during the French rule on Vietnam, the coffee plantation started in a big way and steadily became one of the prime drivers of the Vietnamese economy even after independence. ‘The King’ therefore started exporting coffee to boost the country economically and that’s where we draw our inspiration from.</p>
            <p><strong>THE BEANY BROMANCE</strong> Our mission from the start has been to provide coffee products that don’t burden the wallet and are easily accessible to consumers across both online and offline channels. Over the years, we have grown to new heights by adapting to changing environments, and by continuously expanding our core product range and market niches. Don’t just take our word for it, experience our cold coffees in Mocha, Vanilla, Original, Hazelnut & Latte and judge them for yourselves. And if you like to brew your own coffee, Kings Cold Coffee also comes in medium and dark roasts packages. Go ahead, grab yourself a cuppa!</p>
